The envisioned use case for this is opening GitHub issues for typos in webpages. To use, select some text on the page. A popover will appear with options, including opening a GitHub issue. Screenshot of text selected on a page with a popover that has a GitHub icon Click on the GitHub icon in the popover. A new window will open with new GitHub issue for the repository. The body of the GitHub issue will be pre-filled with the text selection and a link to the page. Screenshot of a new GitHub issue pre-filled with the selected text Details The share-this provides the ability to share selections of text from a page. I extended it by writing a new GitHub sharer. Setup Right now this is a proof of concept, so the only method is manually copying what is done in this repository. Copy these files into your bookdown repository: assets/share-this/*: distribution files copied from the share-this JavaScript package. assets/share-this-github/*: JavaScript and CSS assets for the GitHub sharer includes/share-this.html: A snippet of HTML included in each HTML page by bookdown. Some lines could be uncommented to load other sharers. Configuration and initialization is handled by the share-this-config.js file. It needs to be configured with the GitHub repository associated with the site. // settings for ShareThis const shareThis = window.ShareThis; // uncomment to load a twitter sharer // const twitterSharer = window.ShareThisViaTwitter; // set this to your const githubRepo = &quot;jrnold/bookdown-github-issues&quot;; // optionally add a github label to use const githubIssueLabel = null; const githubSharer = new GitHubIssueSharer(githubRepo, label = githubIssueLabel); const selectionShare = shareThis({ // sharers: [ githubSharer, twitterSharer ] sharers: [ githubSharer ] }); selectionShare.init(); Add this line to _output.yml: bookdown::gitbook: # ... includes: in_header: - &quot;includes/share-this.html&quot; "]
