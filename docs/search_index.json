The GitHub sharer needs to be configured with the GitHub repository associated with the site. ## // settings for ShareThis const shareThis = window.ShareThis; const twitterSharer = window.ShareThisViaTwitter; // set this to your const githubRepo = &quot;jrnold/r4ds-exercise-solutions&quot;; // optionally add a github label to use const githubIssueLabel = null; const githubSharer = new GitHubIssueSharer(githubRepo, label = githubIssueLabel); const selectionShare = shareThis({ sharers: [ githubSharer, twitterSharer ] }); selectionShare.init(); The necessary files for this are: assets/share-this/*: distribution files copied from assets/share-this-github/*: Javascript and CSS assets for the GitHub sharer includes/share-this.html: A snippet of HTML included in each HTML page by bookdown.
