The envisioned use case is a reader spots a typo. They select the text. A popup opens with a button to click to open a GitHub issue. If they click on it, then they are taken to a new page to open GitHub issus. The issueâ€™s message is pre-filled with the text that they selected and a link to the page on which they found it. The share-this provides the ability to share selections of text from a page. I extended it by writing a new GitHub sharer. This also depends on FontAwesome for the GitHub icon. Setup Right now this is a proof of concept, so the only method is manually copying what is done in this repository. Copy these files into your bookdown repository: assets/share-this/*: distribution files copied from the share-this Javascript package. assets/share-this-github/*: JavaScript and CSS assets for the GitHub sharer includes/share-this.html: A snippet of HTML included in each HTML page by bookdown. Some lines could be uncommented to load other sharers. Configuration and initialization is handled by the share-this-config.js file. It needs to be configured with the GitHub repository associated with the site. // settings for ShareThis const shareThis = window.ShareThis; // uncomment to load a twitter sharer // const twitterSharer = window.ShareThisViaTwitter; // set this to your const githubRepo = &quot;jrnold/bookdown-github-issues&quot;; // optionally add a github label to use const githubIssueLabel = null; const githubSharer = new GitHubIssueSharer(githubRepo, label = githubIssueLabel); const selectionShare = shareThis({ // sharers: [ githubSharer, twitterSharer ] sharers: [ githubSharer ] }); selectionShare.init(); Add this line to _output.yml: bookdown::gitbook: # ... includes: in_header: - &quot;includes/share-this.html&quot; "]
