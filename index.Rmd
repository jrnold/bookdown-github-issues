# Opening GitHub Issues by Selecting Text {-}

This bookdown document is a proof-of-concept for opening GitHub issues from a  [Medium-like](https://medium.com/) selection of text on a page.
The envisioned use case for this is opening GitHub issues for typos in webpages.

To use, select some text on the page. A popover will appear with options, including opening a GitHub issue.

Click on the GitHub icon in the popover.
A new window will open with new GitHub issue for the repository.
The body of the GitHub issue will be pre-filled with the text selection and a link
to the page.

## Details {-}

The [share-this](https://github.com/MaxArt2501/share-this) provides the ability to share selections of text from a page.
I extended it by writing a new GitHub sharer.

## Setup {-}

Right now this is a proof of concept, so the only method is manually copying what is done in this repository.
Copy these files into your bookdown repository:

-   `assets/share-this/*`: distribution files copied from the share-this JavaScript package.
-   `assets/share-this-github/*`: JavaScript and CSS assets for the GitHub sharer
-   `includes/share-this.html`: A snippet of HTML included in each HTML page by bookdown. Some lines could be uncommented to load other sharers.

Configuration and initialization is handled by the `share-this-config.js` file.
It needs to be configured with the GitHub repository associated with the site.

```javascript
// settings for ShareThis
const shareThis = window.ShareThis;
// uncomment to load a twitter sharer
// const twitterSharer = window.ShareThisViaTwitter;

// set this to your
const githubRepo = "jrnold/bookdown-github-issues";
// optionally add a github label to use
const githubIssueLabel = null;
const githubSharer = new GitHubIssueSharer(githubRepo, label = githubIssueLabel);

const selectionShare = shareThis({
    // sharers: [ githubSharer, twitterSharer ]
    sharers: [ githubSharer ]
});
selectionShare.init();
```

Add this line to `_output.yml`:
```yaml
bookdown::gitbook:
  # ...
  includes:
    in_header:
    - "includes/share-this.html"
```
